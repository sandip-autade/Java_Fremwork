		for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
		
		
		 class Student {  
	     int rollno;  
	     String name;  
	     String college="ITS";  
		}  
	
		Suppose there are 500 students in my college, now all instance data members will get memory each time when the object is created. 
		All students have its unique rollno and name, so instance data member is good in such case. Here, "college" refers to the common property of all objects. 
		If we make it static, this field will get the memory only once.
