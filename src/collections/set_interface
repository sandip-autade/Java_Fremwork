			HashSet is an unordered & unsorted collection of the data set, whereas the LinkedHashSet is an ordered 
			and sorted collection of HashSet.
			
			HashSet does not provide any method to maintain the insertion order. Comparatively, 
			LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of the elements.
			
			The HashSet and LinkedHashSet both implement the Set interface.
			
			HashSet is slightly faster than the LinkedHashSet. But both provide almost similar performance,
			
			Both provide o(1) complicity for inserting, removing, retrieving the object.
			
			Both the HashSet and LinkedHashSet allows only one null objects.
			
			The LinkedHashSet requires more memory than the HashSet.
			
			
			
		Tree Set
		
			Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
			
			Java TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quiet fast.
			
			Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null element.
			
			Java TreeSet class is non synchronized.
			
			Java TreeSet class maintains ascending order.
