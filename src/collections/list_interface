						ArrayList														Vector
				
		1) ArrayList is not synchronized.								Vector is synchronized.
		
		2) ArrayList increments 50% of current array size               Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if the total number of elements exceeds than its capacity.
		   if the number of elements exceeds from its capacity.	
		   
		3) ArrayList is not a legacy class. 							Vector is a legacy class.
		
		4) ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.			Vector is slow because it is synchronized, 
																		i.e., in a multithreading environment, it holds the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of the object.
																		
		5) ArrayList uses the Iterator interface to traverse 			A Vector can use the Iterator interface or Enumeration interface to traverse the elements
		   the elements.	
		   
		   
		   
		Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
		
		
						ArrayList														LinkedList
				
		1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to 				LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
		   store the elements.	
		   
		2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because 					Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
		   it internally uses an array. If any element 
		   is removed from the array, all the bits are 
		   shifted in memory.	
		   
		3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because 			LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
		   it implements List only.	
		   
		4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.			LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
		   the elements.
