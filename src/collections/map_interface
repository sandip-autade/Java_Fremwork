			1) HashMap is non synchronized. 								It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
			   It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many 		
			   threads without proper synchronization code.	Hashtable 
			   is synchronized. 
			   									
			2) HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.		Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.

			4) HashMap is fast.												Hashtable is slow.
			
			5) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this 		Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.
			   code
			   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);
			   	
			6) HashMap is traversed by Iterator.							Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.
			
			7) Iterator in HashMap is fail-fast.							Enumerator in Hashtable is not fail-fast.
			
			8) HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.							Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.
