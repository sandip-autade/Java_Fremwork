		 					 for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
		 					 
		 					 
		Advantage of Encapsulation in Java
		
						By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only. 
						In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
						
						It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id 
						which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method. 
						You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.
						
						It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access 
						the data through the private data members.
						
						The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing
