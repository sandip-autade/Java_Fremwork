				There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle, 
				there are three types of exceptions:

						1)	Checked Exception
						2)	Unchecked Exception
						3)	Error
						
		1) Checked Exception
		
			The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions 
			e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. 
			
			Note : Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
			
		2) Unchecked Exception
		
			The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions 
			e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. 
			
			Note : Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
			
		3) Error
		
			Error is irrecoverable 
			e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
