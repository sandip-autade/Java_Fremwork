			A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing. It is a separate path of execution.
		
			Threads are independent. If there occurs exception in one thread, 
			it doesn't affect other threads. It uses a shared memory area.
			
			
			
		Creating a Thread:
		
		
			There are two ways to create a thread.
			
		1)	It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method :	
			
					public class Main extends Thread {
					  public void run() {
					    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
					  }
					}
					
		2)  Another way to create a thread is to implement the Runnable interface :
		
					public class Main implements Runnable {
					  public void run() {
					    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
					  }
					}
