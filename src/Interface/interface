	       			Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
	
					It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
					
					Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
					
					Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.
					
					
					
		Why use Java interface ?
		
		
			There are mainly three reasons to use interface :
					
					It is used to achieve abstraction.
					
					By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
					
					It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
