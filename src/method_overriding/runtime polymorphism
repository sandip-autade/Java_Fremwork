

		Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method 
		is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
		
				In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. 
				The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
